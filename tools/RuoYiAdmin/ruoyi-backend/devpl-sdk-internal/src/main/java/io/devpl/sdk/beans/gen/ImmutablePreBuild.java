/**
 * Annotation defining a method that is to be called just before a code generated immutable bean is built.
 * <p>
 * This is used when an immutable bean wants to perform an action on the builder just
 * before it is built into a bean. The action might include validation (normally done
 * using {@link ImmutableValidator}) and defaulting (normally done using {@link ImmutableDefaults}).
 * <p>
 * The special use case for this annotation is the ability to default the value of one property
 * from the value of another. For example, consider a bean with two dates, where one is derived
 * from the other (such as the second being the first adjusted to a valid business day).
 * Use of this annotation allows the second date to be set to the same as the first date if
 * a value is not set.
 * <p>
 * The method must be a private static void instance method that takes a single argument of the type 'Builder'.
 * The method will be called at the start of the {@code build()} method of the builder.
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 *   {@literal @}ImmutablePreBuild
 *   private static void preBuild(Builder builder) {
 *     if (builder.date2 == null) {
 *       builder.date2 = builder.date1;  // default date2 to be same as date1
 *     }
 *   }
 * </pre>
