/**
 * Annotation defining which method is to be used to apply the default property values
 * when code generating immutable beans.
 * <p>
 * Each non-collection property in an immutable bean normally has to be initialized before use.
 * This annotation allows default values to be set when creating the builder.
 * Note that the defaults apply to the builder, not to the constructor of the bean.
 * <p>
 * The method must be a private static void instance method that takes a single argument of the type 'Builder'.
 * Private is necessary as it is called from the builder constructor.
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 *   {@literal @}ImmutableDefaults
 *   private static void applyDefaults(Builder builder) {
 *     builder.group(Group.STANDARD);  // default the group property to 'STANDARD'
 *   }
 * </pre>
