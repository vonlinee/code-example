/**
 * Base implementations of Joda-Bean interfaces.
 * <p>
 * The Joda-Bean interfaces introduce a number of concepts and this package introduces
 * basic implementations of them. The implementations are in a simple and standard form.
 * It is recommended to extend these base classes where possible, however there may
 * be a faster implementation available.
