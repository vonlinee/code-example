	 * A {@link BuilderFactory} is used to enable custom controls that need special initialization to be used with FXML.
	 * MvvmFX can manage multiple builder factories. If you add multiple factories that can provide builders for the same type,
	 * the last added builder factory will be used. This way it's possible to "overwrite" a more abstract builder factory with a more specific
	 * factory.
	 * <br/>
	 * MvvmFX also takes care for handling the default {@link javafx.fxml.JavaFXBuilderFactory}. If no custom builder factory
	 * is able to provide a builder for a given type the default JavaFX builder factory will be used as last resort.
	 * This way you don't have to take care for standard JavaFX types in your builder factory.
	 * <br/>
	 * While most of the time using a global builder factory is the best approach, for some special use cases
	 * it's needed to define a special builder factory that is only used for a single loading procedure.
	 * For such use cases one can use the {@link ViewLoader} with the parameter
	 * {@link ViewLoader.FxmlViewStep#builderFactory(BuilderFactory)} instead.
	 * In this case the provided builder factory is again combined with the global factories (if defined).
	 * Builder factories provided via {@link ViewLoader} have a higher priority then global builder factories.
