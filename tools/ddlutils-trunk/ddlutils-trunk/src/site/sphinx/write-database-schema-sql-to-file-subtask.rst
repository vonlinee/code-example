writeSchemaSqlToFile
====================

Creates the SQL commands necessary to re-create the schema in the database. In contrast to the
sub task of the same name in the :doc:`DdlToDatabaseTask <ddl-to-database-task>`, this sub task
operates on the schema in the database.

Attributes
----------
    
``alterDatabase``
    :Required: no
    :Allowed: ``true``, ``false``
    :Default: ``true``
    :Meaning: Specifies whether DdlUtils shall alter existing tables rather than dropping them and
              creating them new.

``doDrops``
    :Required: no
    :Allowed: ``true``, ``false``
    :Default: ``true``
    :Meaning: Whether tables and external constraints can be dropped if necessary. Note that this is also
              relevant when ``alterDatabase`` is ``true``. For instance, a table has a
              foreign key constraint in the database but not in the schema. If ``doDrops`` = ``true``
              then DdlUtils will drop the constraint, otherwise it will be unchanged thus possibly leading
              to unexpected errors.

``failOnError``
    :Required: no
    :Allowed: ``true``, ``false``
    :Default: ``true``
    :Meaning: Specifies whether the execution shall stop if an error has occurred while the task runs.

``outputFile``
    :Required: yes
    :Allowed:
    :Default:
    :Meaning: The name of the file to write the SQL commands to.
