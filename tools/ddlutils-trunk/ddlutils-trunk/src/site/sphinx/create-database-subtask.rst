createDatabase
==============

This is the sub task for creating the target database. Note that this is only supported on some database
platforms. See :doc:`here <database-support>` for details on which platforms support this.

This sub task does not require schema files. Therefore the ``fileset`` subelement and the
``schemaFile`` attributes can be omitted.

Attributes
----------
    
``failOnError``
    :Required: no
    :Allowed: ``true``, ``false``
    :Default: ``true``
    :Meaning: Specifies whether the execution shall stop if an error has occurred while the task runs.

Subelements
-----------

``parameter``
    Specifies a parameter for the creation of the database. These are usually platform specific.

    *Attributes*
    
    ``name``
        :Required: yes
        :Allowed:
        :Default:

                  for the parameters supported by the individual platforms.

    ``platforms``
        :Required: no
        :Allowed:
        :Default:
        :Meaning: Comma-separated list of platforms where the parameter shall be processed (see
                  ``databaseType`` attribute above for the possible values). For every platform
                  not in this list, the parameter is ignored. If none is given, then the parameter
                  is processed for every platform.

    ``value``
        :Required: no
        :Allowed:
        :Default:
